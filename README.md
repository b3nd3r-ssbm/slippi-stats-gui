# Credits
The stat-accumulating scripts were taken (with express permission from IvantheTricourne, aka setBaNG) from <a href="https://github.com/IvantheTricourne/slippi-scripts">This repository</a>, and moved from a hosted web server to client-side NodeJS using electron, in order to improve streaming performance and user-friendliness, as well as generally being a cleaner way of doing things.
